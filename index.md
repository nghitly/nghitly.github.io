### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 holds a special place for me because it was my first real introduction 
    to the Computer Science course. It was the first opportunity to test out my 
    skills in the C++ aspect, where I learned to define te main function, used 
    std::cout for outputs and implement more of what I initially learned with my 
    professor into my coding. This lab also taught me that relying on people was 
    a must and that asking for help is very necessary.

* Lab 3, Part 1

    Part 1 of Lab 3 helped me learn how to implement mathematical formulas 
    using functions in C++ and apply them to solve real-world problems. I also
    got to practice creating and using functions to perform calculations, making 
    my code organized and reusable. All in all, the lab really helped me with my 
    usage of the std::cin and std::cout commands.

* Lab 11, Part 1

    Part 1 of Lab 11 is also one of my favorites because I learned how to 
    implement functionality to read data from a CSV file, and
    then process it into a structured format. This lab helped me
    get used to data conversions, object-oriented programming, and 
    how to use if streams to read data froma  file. Although this lab
    was not fun, it was a necessity for me.
